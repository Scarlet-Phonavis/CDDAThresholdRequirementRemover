Clears up all Mutation Cancels in Input and throws it in Output


Meant to simplify workflow by taking a folder with a mod.json and mutations and cancelling it, for classes usually


...Obviously the input is meant to be sorted first, but you can try running the game through it and see what happens?


This does use "Copyfrom" and a "Empty Cancel List", I know of "Addition"'s existence but I remember not using it for some reason, this seems to work fine
