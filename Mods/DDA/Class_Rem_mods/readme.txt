Various mods designed around removing the cancels of certain mutations, usually spells
Threshold Mutations will be elsewhere, this is specifically non Threshold, which requires more manual work as just cancelling every mutation's conflicts would cause problems
No guarentee these break nothing, feel free to add to the stash, there's a script in Scripts to make life easier

Magiclysm can be found here https://github.com/martinrhan/Magiclysm_No_Class_Limit 
I don't think you need it if you're using magiclysm additions though as that seems to remove the class limit, I am unsure about attunements however
